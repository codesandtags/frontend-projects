# Folder Tree

This is a simple folder tree that displays a list of folders and files. The tree is built using `React` and `TypeScript`. The tree is expandable and collapsible, and it displays the folder structure in a hierarchical manner.

## Implementation considerations

The folder tree is built using a recursive component that renders the folder structure. The component receives a list of folders and files as props and renders the folder structure accordingly. The component uses `React` hooks to manage the state of the tree and to handle the expand and collapse functionality.

# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against with a friend. The game will highlight who the winner is.

## Implementation considerations

- This game is using `React`
- For state management, I used `useState` hook to manage the game state.
- The game is responsive and can be played on both desktop and mobile devices using `grid` and `flexbox` for layout.

## Demo
